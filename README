Protobuf compiler plugin for generation of boost::python bindings,
which wrap the C++ implementation generated by protoc.

Generated bindings are suitable for transparent integration into other
boost::python wrapped code, allowing C++ methods taking or returning protobuf
message instances to be directly exposed to python.

The plugin entry-point is 'protoc-gen-bplbindings', and can be invoked via:
 protoc --bplbindings_out=output/path input/path/my_messages.proto

Each message defined in my_messages.proto will create a corresponding cpp
source with the message's bindings. _my_messages.cpp will also be created,
with BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE() shared library initialization.

plugin_pb2.py is included; the source can be found in your installation at:
 ($PREFIX)/include/google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto
